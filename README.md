# WGU Masters of Science in Cyber Security and Information Assurance
![WGU LOGO](./images/wgu_logo.png)

This is my portfolio of my coursework for my MS Cyber Security & Information Assurance (MSCSIA) at Western Govenors University.  I'm pursuing this degree to further augment my general knowledge as well as to strengthen my role as a Site Reliability Engineer.  I'm hoping that by sharing this portfolio it'll help other students as well as serve as a proof of work to future employers.
